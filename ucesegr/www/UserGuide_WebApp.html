<p><h1>UCL WebApp: set up question for QuizApp â€“ User guide</h1></p>
</div>


<h2>Guide content</h2> <!-- Content of the user guide for the browser-based app -->
<p >The following guide explains how to use the UCL WebApp and to set up new questions for the QuizApp for mobile. 
Here is the content of the guide:</p>
<p><i> - System requirements;</i></p>
<p><i> - How to start the app;</i></p>
<p><i> - How the app works.</i></p>
<p>The app is developed for technical users who manage QuizApp, in order to set up new questions. 
It should not be used by final users, since it requires at least a basic technical knowledge in order to
be edited.</p>


<h2>System requirements</h2> <!-- minimum requirements to run the app -->
<p>The app simply needs a browser to be run. It works on Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Safari
and Mozilla Firefox.</p>
<p>The user must be connected to the UCL VPN in order to load the web page of the app. We recommend the 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cisco.anyconnect.vpn.android.avf&amp;hl=it"> Cisco AnyConnect</a> 
app to establish the VPN connection; further information about how to connect to the UCL VPN can be found on the following 
<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/get-connected/remote-working/vpn">link</a>.</p>


<h2>How to start the app</h2> <!-- how to start the app: it requires a server connection to work -->
<p>The app is an on-line application available at the 
<a href="http://developer.cege.ucl.ac.uk:31279/">WebApp web page</a>
. Hence, there is no need to install it on a device.</p>
<p>Before opening the app, the user must be connected to the UCL VPN and must start  both the server and the Phonegap server 
through an SSH software. We recommend <a href="https://www.bitvise.com/">Bitvise</a> for the Windows environment, while 
<a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/download.html">Fugu SSH</a> is agood alternative for the iOS environment. 
The connection is established by using the following credentials:</p> <!-- credentials to access the server and start it -->
<p><b>Host</b>: developer.cege.ucl.ac.uk</p>
<p><b>Port</b>: 30079</p>
<p><b>Username</b>: studentuser</p>
<p><b>Password</b>: XXXXXX - contact the administrator for the password</p>
<p>Once the connection starts, the user has to type the following commands on the terminal to make the server run:</p>
<p> - cd /home/studentuser/code (press enter)</p>
<p> - node NodeJSserver.js (press enter - the server is activated and data can be uploaded/downloaded)</p>
<p> - cd WebApp/ucesibi (press enter)</p>
<p> - sudo su (press enter and enter the password)</p>
<p> - phonegap serve (press enter - the Phonegap server is activated and the app can be run)</p>
<p>At this point, the user can finally access to the 
<a href="http://developer.cege.ucl.ac.uk:31279/">WebApp web page</a> 
to set up new questions.</p>


<h2>How the app works</h2> <!-- the paragraph explaisn how to use the app and the options provided to accomplish its tasks -->
<p>The app is developed to be used on a computer, however it can be used also on mobile devices. In this case, it could
be less convenient to insert new data.</p>
<p>The WebApp has a main interface which contains a map that can be explored by the user to find new locations to place
a point. The coordinates of a specific location can be extracted by clicking on the map, so a pop-up window will show 
the latitude and the longitude of that point; those can be copied and subsequently pasted in the respective fields in
the <i>question form</i>. </p>
<p>The <i>left-side menu</i> has two options:</p>
<p><b>Add a question</b>: the button will redirect the user to the question form that must be used to create a new question;</p>
<p><b>Load Points</b>: the button will load the points of interest already uploaded on the server. It could be useful to know where
points have already been placed in order to avoid repetitions.</p>
<p>From the <i>top-right menu</i> the user can access both this user guide (User Guide link) and additional documentation that
gives more information about the app and its functionalities (More Info link).</p>
<p>The <i>question form</i> contains all the fields required to set up a new question. Once the user has filled all of them,
they must click on the <i>Upload data</i> button to upload and to store the new data on the server. To set up another 
question, the user could go back to the map to check the coordinates and open the question form again.</p>
